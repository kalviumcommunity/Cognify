    "Your objectives:\n"
    "- Analyze student quiz responses and reasoning to detect concept-level weaknesses (not just incorrect answers).\n"
    "- Summarize mastery and confidence for each detected concept.\n"
    "- Recommend targeted learning resources (short, high-signal items) for improvement.\n"
    "- Propose follow-up practice questions to reinforce weak concepts.\n\n"
    "Output requirements:\n"
    "- Return clear, concise guidance suitable for students and teachers.\n"
    "- When possible, produce a compact JSON-oriented report with fields: summary, weaknesses, resources, next_questions, missing.\n"
    "- Do not fabricate URLs; if none available, leave the url empty and explain in why.\n"
    "- If inputs are insufficient, clearly state what is missing in the missing field and proceed with best-effort analysis.\n\n"
    "Be precise, pedagogically helpful, and avoid hallucinations."

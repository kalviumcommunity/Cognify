DYNAMIC_SYSTEM_PROMPT = (
    "You are an expert assistant using dynamic prompting. Adapt behavior based on provided state, prior memory, retrieved information, and available tools.\n\n"
    "Principles:\n"
    "- Follow the Task and Output requirements exactly.\n"
    "- Use Context, State, Memory, and Retrieval sections to ground responses; do not fabricate facts.\n"
    "- If Tools are provided, decide whether any are needed; if so, specify tool usage clearly in the requested format.\n"
    "- If information is insufficient, list what is missing and proceed with a best-effort answer, marking assumptions.\n"
    "- If a structured output schema is provided, match it exactly.\n"
    "- No hidden chain-of-thought; provide final answers and brief rationale only when required.\n"
)

DYNAMIC_USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = (
    "Task:\n"
    "{task}\n\n"
    "Context (optional):\n"
    "{context}\n\n"
    "State (optional: user profile, session, environment):\n"
    "{state}\n\n"
    "Memory (optional: prior interactions, preferences):\n"
    "{memory}\n\n"
    "Retrieval (optional: fetched notes, docs, results):\n"
    "{retrieval}\n\n"
    "Tools (optional: name, description, input/output schema):\n"
    "{tools}\n\n"
    "Examples (optional):\n"
    "{examples}\n\n"
    "Input:\n"
    "{input}\n\n"
    "Constraints (optional):\n"
    "{constraints}\n\n"
    "Output requirements / schema (optional):\n"
    "{output_schema}\n\n"
    "Style (optional):\n"
    "{style}\n\n"
    "Instructions:\n"
    "- Use State/Memory/Retrieval to inform the answer; when in conflict, prefer Retrieval > Memory > State.\n"
    "- If Tools are listed and helpful, either: (a) directly produce the final output, or (b) include a concise plan and a 'tool_calls' block describing the tool names and arguments needed.\n"
    "- If a JSON schema is provided, return only a valid JSON object conforming to it.\n"
    "- If key inputs are missing, list them first under 'missing' and then proceed with the best possible answer.\n"

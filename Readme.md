# 📚 Knowledge Gap Analyzer & Tutor  
> **AI-driven system that identifies students’ knowledge gaps and recommends personalized resources for improvement.**

---

## ✅ Project Highlights  
- 🔍 **Identify Weak Concepts** – Goes beyond scores to pinpoint exact knowledge gaps  
- 📖 **Personalized Learning Paths** – AI-driven recommendations for articles, videos, and notes  
- 🔄 **Adaptive Feedback** – Converts simple quizzes into actionable insights  
- 🤖 **Automation with AI** – Email reports, dashboard display, and extra practice questions

## ✨ **Overview**  
Students often struggle to identify the exact concepts they have misunderstood. Traditional quizzes only provide a score, **not actionable feedback**.  

Our solution uses **AI + RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to:  
✅ Analyze student responses  
✅ Detect weak concepts  
✅ Recommend personalized resources  
✅ Automate revision plans
